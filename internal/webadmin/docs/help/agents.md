# Agents

Agents are the AI backends that process your messages and generate responses.

## Connecting an Agent

To connect an agent to the gateway, run:

```bash
coven agent
```

The agent will automatically register with the gateway and appear in your Agents list.

## Agent Status

Agents can have the following statuses:

- **Connected**: Agent is online and ready to receive messages
- **Idle**: Agent is connected but not currently processing requests
- **Busy**: Agent is actively processing a request

## Multiple Agents

You can connect multiple agents simultaneously. When starting a new chat, you'll be prompted to select which agent to use.

## Agent Capabilities

Each agent may have different capabilities and tools available. Check the Tools tab in Settings to see what tools are available from your connected agents.
